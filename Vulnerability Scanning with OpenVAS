   The calculator shown here can make calculations based on several different vectors to derive a CVSS score that is used for rating CVEs.
   
4. A popup will appear for 10 seconds and then close. Notice it goes to the purple icon in the upper-left. Click on the purple wizard icon to open the Task Wizard.

5. Configure a default scan against the OWASP server by typing the IP address `192.168.68.12` into the Quick start text field.
   
6. Click **Start Scan**.

   This scan will take 10-20 minutes depending on your system; wait until the scan finishes before moving on to the next step. The scan will finish once the progress bar reaches 100% or “Done”.
